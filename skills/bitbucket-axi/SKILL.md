# bitbucket-axi

Inspect repositories, pull requests, and pipelines in Bitbucket Cloud with agent-efficient output.

## When to use

Use bitbucket-axi whenever a task needs Bitbucket Cloud repository details, pull requests, pipeline runs, raw API access, or credential setup for those operations. It also provides an opt-in Git HTTPS credential helper; SSH remains the default Git transport.

Get every command, flag, and workflow from the live CLI - it is the single source of truth:

- `npx -y bitbucket-axi` - dashboard for the current repository
- `npx -y bitbucket-axi --help` - global usage
- `npx -y bitbucket-axi <command> --help` - per-command usage

API credentials are stored in the OS credential manager. If the CLI reports that credentials are missing, run `npx -y bitbucket-axi config set`; for automation, provide the account email and pipe the token to `npx -y bitbucket-axi config set --email <email> --token-stdin`.
